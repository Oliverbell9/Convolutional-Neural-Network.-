# Convolutional-Neural-Network

In this project, I will be discussing CNN, the Convolutional Neural Network. This is a network architecture for deep learningâ€¯that focuses on the processing of data that has a grid pattern, such as images. CNN can also be used for classifying audio, time series, and signal data.

Some important points to note:

i.  Convolutional Neural Network Architecture is composed of an input layer, an output layer, and many hidden layers in between.

ii. CNN provides an optimal architecture for uncovering and learning key features in image and time-series data. CNN is a key technology in applications such as Medical Imaging, Object Detection, Audio Processing, and Synthetic Data Generation.

iii. CNN can handle large amounts of data.
